## Project Overview

The purpose of this analysis was to analyze the bikesharing data from CitiBike in New York City for presentation to investors who are looking to start the same business in Des Moines, Iowa.


## Results

### Checkout Times for Users
From the line graph, we can see that most of the trips are under an hour length. The peak trip duration is 5 minutes and it gradually declines, indicating lower number of trips for rides that are over an hour.

 ### Number of Trips by Weekday
 The heatmap shows the number of rides at each hour of the day for the month of August. Clearly we can identify high usage in the morning rush hours and in the evening (after work). There are low usage between 2AM and 5AM which makes it a good time to conduct repairs.

 ### August Peak Hours
This bar chart displays the number of bike rides initiated during each hour of the day, totaled across the entire month of August. There is a peak usage in the morning (when people are heading to work/ school) and in the evening (when heading home). It would be profitable to coduct maintainance and repairs between 2AM and 5PM.

 ## Summary
 In conclusion, bikeshare services are remarkably popular in busy metropolitan areas due to work and business areas, where occupied real estate is densely packed and parking spaces may be scarce. The user base is made up mostly of male subscribers. More outreach should be done to attract female riders a good way is start a fitness program where they are encouraged to exercise and earn money for how long they bike.The main usage seems focused around morning and evening commute times.
 
 Additional visualizations to perform is to discover the age groups amongst genders which utilise the bike program the most and also looking at potential factors which can affect trip durations through day e.g traffic.
